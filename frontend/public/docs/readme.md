# **pull request** 

I am **Omkar**

I am developing this Portfolio to learn frontend development 

I am using `React, Tailwindcss` 

For version controling [git *clickable*], github

This is still in process. I don't understand how to do this markdown fully workable.

# What i did -
- I installed the [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) 
- *Setup* 
- npm i react-markdown

```
import content from 'file';
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
const blog = () => {
 return (
    <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}>{content}</ReactMarkdown>
 )
}
```
